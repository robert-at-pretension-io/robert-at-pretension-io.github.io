      Leading a happy, healthy, and impactful life requires more than fixing the
      negative. It also requires increasing the positives in our lives. Our
      minds naturally focus on the negative to reduce the possibility of
      something bad happening. Now, this is necessary in some situations like
      crossing the street, protecting yourself from strangers, or securing your
      home. But when it comes to your emotions? Your productivity? Your
      relationships? You function much better in a positive state of mind.

      When your mind reaches a positive state, you not only feel better, but
      your creativity rises, your energy levels increase, and you are able to
      clearly see more opportunities.
