              <p class="service-description">
                You are not alone. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is more common than you may imagine, affecting people across all walks of life.
                Characterized by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors
                (compulsions) that individuals feel compelled to perform, it is a chronic and often distressing
                condition. Driven by distress and anxiety, OCD manifests in varied forms.
                Rituals develop, such as excessive cleaning, checking, or arranging items in a specific order.
                
                
                Together, you and I will incorporate techniques from Cognitive-
                behavioral therapy (CBT), the most commonly used psychotherapy approach for OCD.
                Within CBT, a specific form called Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is highly effective
                in treating OCD. We may use ERP to gradually expose you to anxiety-provoking situations while
                preventing the accompanying compulsive behaviors.</p>

                The combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Positive Psychology is extremely
                effective in combating depression. We will use CBT techniques to challenge negative thinking
                patterns that contribute to your depression, which can bring you to a neutral state; however, it is
                the use of Positive Psychology that will aid you in feeling truly happy. Through Positive
                
                Psychology, we will identify your strengths to build resilience, incorporate exercises that will
                change your brain to think more positively, and enrich your relationships.</p>

              <p class="service-description">
                When a person thinks about negative experiences in the future repetitively, they could be experiencing
                anxiety. These thoughts are a natural self-protection mechanism; however, when a person persistently
                thinks of these negative thoughts without finding a solution, they become anxious. I can help you
                identify when you start ruminating, identify triggers, and help you come up with a plan to address your
                anxiety using Solution Focused Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.</p>

              <p class="service-description">
                Life often presents us with stressful situations that cannot be changed. As a psychotherapist, I can assist you in managing stress through Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Through targeted emotion regulation strategies, we will explore ways for you to identify, understand, and effectively manage your emotions. Moreover, we will address interpersonal effectiveness, supporting you in developing healthy communication and assertiveness skills, ultimately reducing stress in your relationships.</p>

              <p class="service-description">
                The key to emotion regulation is first exploring and identifying one’s emotions. I provide a safe and non-
                judgmental place for you to do this. We will then identify triggers and behavior patterns that contribute
                to emotion dysregulation. Through various therapeutic techniques, such as emotion identification
                exercises and cognitive restructuring, you will learn practical skills to manage and regulate your
                emotions effectively. I can also help you identify your values and support your growth, so your
                actions align with your values, giving you peace and happiness.

                Major life changes can be expected or unexpected, typical, or maybe you’re the only person you know
                experiencing your situation. These situations can be incredibly stressful, especially when you are
                uncertain of your future. I can help you with strategies to manage your stress, assist in developing
                coping strategies and problem-solving skills to manage challenges that arise during the
                transition, making it easier for you to view your situation not as a loss but an opportunity for
                growth. By working collaboratively, we will build resilience, adaptability, and a sense of
                empowerment to embrace and thrive through life's transitions.</p>

                Changing your brain or what is also known as cognitive restructuring to think more positively
                begins with evidence-based exercises from the field of positive psychology. Often people who
                have negative thought patterns were raised in an environment that taught them to be that way.
                Fortunately, this also means you can teach your brain to build realistic and positive thought
                patterns. Together you and I will identify your strengths, broaden your perspective, and
                incorporate techniques from Positive Psychology which will create a ripple effective in your life

                I can help you transform and create more positive relationships by helping you set healthy boundaries
                and expressing your point of view in a kind and assertive manner. Often people sacrifice too much, are
                disappointed in other’s behavior, or someone has so much stress it is released on the people who may
                or may not be involved in the source of the stress. Together you and I will determine what is most
                important: the relationship, your self-respect, or the goal of the situation. Then we will develop a plan to
                manage these various situations.</p>

                meaningful and happy life. Becoming disabled often effects your career, family, friends, and leisure
                activities. It is an exceedingly difficult process; however, after going through the grief process, it can
                also be an opportunity to build a new identity. I can help you with this process and connect you to
                resources that will help you in building your new self.</p>

                Growing up visually impaired (VI) or blind or becoming VI or blind is an experience that
                affects all aspects of life. When a child grows up VI/blind, they often face increased stress at
                school, can be socially ostracized, and experience anxiety and depression due to feeling alone.
                The loss of sight later in life can be traumatizing because you lose a large part of who you are. I
                specialize in helping individuals build their self-esteem, find ways to better socialize and
                integrate into society, navigate the emotional challenges as someone who is VI/blind, and
                navigate the Social Determinates of Health such as the educational, government, health care,
